v1.16 - 1 October 2016
  - Addresses https://github.com/sstrickl/rolldice/issues/10.

v1.15 - 16 October 2015
  - Merging in pull requests from Github by Thomas Ross and Shea Polansky
    to fix formatting and various issues in the build process/program.

v1.14 - 18 December 2012
  - Stéphane changed the error handling from following stdlib conventions to
    BSD (sysexits.h) conventions.

v1.13 - 05 August 2012
  - Stéphane found a bug that caused dice strings with subtraction
    (e.g., "1d2-1") to be handled as addition (e.g., like "1d2+1").

v1.12 - 07 June 2012
  - Stéphane Blondon has done some work in improving error messages, the
    handling of version numbers, and also reading dice strings on standard
    input.
  - A github repository is now available: https://github.com/sstrickl/rolldice

v1.11 - 01 Feb 2010
  - Only updating URLs/email addresses.  No bugfixes in this revision,
    though I'll get around to soon.

v1.10 - 25 Nov 2001
  - Forgot to add a couple of entries to the changelogs, I see.  Added them
    back in.
  - Truthfully, eventually I should rewrite this code completely, as I did
    originally write it before I really knew how one should write code like
    this.  Perhaps over the winter break.
  - This version fixes the problem of urandom always being opened, thanks
    to initializing the (u)random file before reading in the command line
    options.  Fixed that, plus replaced my option parsing code with a use
    of getopt_long().

v1.9 - 10 Mar 2001
  - Never checked result of parse_string for unsuccessful parses.  Fixed.

v1.8 - 17 Oct 1999
  - Segfaulted when one didn't specify how many dice to roll (should default
    to one).  Fixed.

v1.7 - 28 Mar 1999
  - Changed dice string parser code, now more to my liking :)
  - Added ability to use multiple dice strings

v1.6 - 27 Mar 1999
  - Added ability to drop a number of lowest die rolls and made reading
    from /dev/urandom the default.  In fact, there is no longer a method
    that uses the rand() function.  If adding this feature back is needed,
    then just contact me and I'll work it back in.

v1.5 - 10 Mar 1999
  - Added ability to print out each individual die roll and added the long
    version of each of the options

v1.4 - 12 Feb 1999
  - Added ability to use "d#" type constructions and "d%" for percentages

v1.3 - 27 Jan 1999
  - Fixed documentation, both in getting rid of childish flames and in
    correcting the dates in the changelog (and anywhere else they might
    be wrong :)

v1.2 - 27 Jan 1999
  - added /dev/(u)random code

v1.1 - 20 Jan 1999
  - Fixed bug involving overflowing and underflowingi because of
    too large or negative dice attributes

v1.0 - 19 Jan 1999
  - Released rolldice
